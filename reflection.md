# Reflection on Assignment 5

## Challenges Faced

### 1. Translating Requirements into Use Cases
One of the main challenges was translating the **functional requirements** from Assignment 4 into **use cases** that accurately represent how users interact with the system. For example, the requirement to "track real-time activity" (FR3) had to be broken down into specific steps, such as starting a workout session, syncing data from a wearable device, and displaying the data on the app. Ensuring that all preconditions, postconditions, and alternative flows were covered required careful analysis of the requirements.

### 2. Creating a Comprehensive Use Case Diagram
Another challenge was creating a **use case diagram** that includes all relevant actors and use cases while maintaining clarity. Balancing the number of actors (e.g., Fitness Enthusiast, Healthcare Provider) and use cases (e.g., "Track Real-Time Activity," "Generate Fitness Analytics") was difficult, especially when trying to avoid clutter. Using **mermaid.js** helped simplify the process, but it still required multiple iterations to get the diagram right.

### 3. Developing Test Cases
Developing **test cases** that cover both functional and non-functional requirements was also challenging. For example, creating a test case for "real-time activity tracking" (FR3) required simulating data from a wearable device and verifying that the system updates the data every 30 seconds. Additionally, defining non-functional test cases, such as performance testing with 100,000 concurrent users, required careful planning to ensure the system meets scalability and performance goals.

## Key Learnings
1. **Use Case Modeling**: I learned how to break down complex requirements into manageable use cases, ensuring that all user interactions are covered.
2. **Test Case Development**: I gained experience in creating detailed test cases that validate both functional and non-functional requirements.
3. **Tool Proficiency**: I became more proficient with tools like **mermaid.js** for creating diagrams and **markdown** for documentation.

## Future Improvements
1. **Automated Testing**: In the future, I would like to explore automated testing tools to streamline the testing process.
2. **Enhanced Use Case Diagrams**: I plan to improve my use case diagrams by adding more details, such as relationships between use cases (e.g., inclusion, extension).
3. **Non-Functional Testing**: I aim to develop more robust non-functional test cases, especially for security and performance.

Overall, this assignment was a valuable learning experience that helped me better understand the process of translating requirements into use cases and test cases.
